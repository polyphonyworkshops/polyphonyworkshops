          We will warm up our voice, learn how to sing specific intervals, and finally sight-sing a small melody.
          <br>
          In this workshop, we will also explore different expressions we can use to describe the character of music as well as recognizing the music period that it belongs to.

        <h2>Coding for Young Musicians</h2>
        <p>With the use of the web-based platform "Scratch", the educational tool for young coders, the students will get an introduction to creative programming with a special focus on music. During this workshop, we will learn how to code with Scratch by making two musical apps. The "virtual piano" and the "alternative orchestra" will introduce students to the relation of music and computers and how this relationship can be a creative expression as well as a helpful tool for understanding music and musical instruments.

          <br>No prior knowledge of programming needed. </p>
